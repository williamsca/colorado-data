# Colorado-Data
This repository contains the source code and data for a longitudinal study of local government finances in Colorado. The scripts use Amazon's Textract service to extract data on property assessments and mill levies from PDF files. The data is then cleaned and exported as a .csv file for public use.

## TODO:
- [ ] manually identify the key tables from the Annual Reports and extract them. Look for "County Valuation by Classification" and all tables in Section X.
